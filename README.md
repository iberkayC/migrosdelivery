# Optimal Route Finder using Ant Colony Optimization and Brute Force Method

Solves the Travelling Salesman Problem using Ant Colony Optimization and Brute Force methods.

## Overview

This project is designed to find the optimal route to visit all houses on a map using two different algorithms: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Brute Force. It includes classes to represent houses, manage the map, draw the map and routes, and implement the optimization algorithms. The project was developed for the CMPE160 Object-Oriented Programming course at Bogazici University. More details about the project can be found in the report file.
